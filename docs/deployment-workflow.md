\# Deployment Workflows



A common pattern in embodied AI deployment is to author the AI models in PyTorch, and then load these models into a C++ or Rust Embodied AI applications that get deployed.



\## The Deployment Pattern



Most embodied AI teams do follow this pattern: develop and train models in PyTorch within simulation environments, then deploy them to embedded C++ or Rust applications for production use. The key deployment technologies include:



\*\*For C++ deployment:\*\*

\- TorchScript for converting PyTorch models to C++ via tracing or scripting, allowing models to run without Python interpreters

\- ONNX Runtime for cross-platform deployment with GPU acceleration support

\- LibTorch (PyTorch's C++ API) for direct integration



\*\*For Rust deployment:\*\*

\- tch-rs provides Rust bindings for PyTorch's C++ API, enabling PyTorch model deployment in Rust applications

\- Cross-compilation capabilities and optimization flags for different hardware architectures



\## QA Approaches for C++/Rust Applications



The QA methodologies for these deployed applications follow established embedded/robotics testing practices:



\### \*\*Unit Testing Frameworks\*\*

For C++:

\- CppUTest and Google Test (gtest) are the primary frameworks, with extensive use of mocks to isolate hardware dependencies

\- Robot-specific testing patterns using fixtures for joint controllers, state machines, and safety-critical components



\### \*\*Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) Testing\*\*

HIL testing simulates sensors, actuators, and mechanical components by connecting real-time mathematical models to the embedded systems being tested, allowing validation before full system integration. This is particularly crucial for embodied AI where:

\- ADAS and autonomous vehicle systems use HIL to test safety-critical functions by sending simulated object lists and sensor data to the unit under test

\- Real-time operating systems like RedHawk Linux provide the deterministic performance needed for HIL simulation



\### \*\*Integration Testing Strategies\*\*

Robotics projects typically employ both unit testing (micro-level) for individual components and integration testing (macro-level) for data/signal flow in combined systems. The approach includes:



\- \*\*Software-in-the-Loop (SIL)\*\*: Testing executable algorithms before hardware integration

\- \*\*Continuous Integration\*\*: Automated testing rigs that compile firmware, flash devices, and validate behavior through physical pin monitoring

\- \*\*Mock-based Testing\*\*: Using mock objects to simulate hardware interfaces, sensors, and external systems for isolated component testing



\### \*\*Modern C++ Best Practices\*\*

Given your C++ experience, the current approaches emphasize:

\- RAII patterns with smart pointers for resource management in test fixtures

\- Hardware Abstraction Layers (HAL) that can be easily mocked for testing

\- Factory patterns with dependency injection to enable hardware-independent testing



\### \*\*Safety-Critical Validation\*\*

For safety-critical embedded applications, certified testing tools like QA-MISRA and Cantata provide static analysis, code coverage, and compliance with standards like ISO 26262 and IEC 61508.



\## Industry Reality



There are ongoing discussions in the PyTorch community about the future of C++ deployment, as the ecosystem moves toward TorchDynamo-based tracing, which currently doesn't produce C++-executable artifacts. However, the fundamental pattern remains strong because production scenarios often require C++ for low-latency, strict deployment requirements, even when bound to other languages.



The QA challenge is significant because robotic software bugs aren't just inconveniences—they can lead to hardware damage or safety incidents, making comprehensive testing frameworks essential for the embodied AI deployment pipeline.
